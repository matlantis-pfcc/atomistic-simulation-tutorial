    "Our previous work has largely focused on industrially used solid materials.\n",
    "Examples of material areas include the following:\n",

    "## Why do we learn atomistic simulation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Atomistic simulation can be used to elucidate the mechanisms of experimentally known phenomena and to develop new materials by analyzing elemental combinations and structures that have never been expected before. <br/>\n",
    "In recent years, the word \"[SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals)](https://sdgs.un.org/goals)\" has become more popular. SDGs are not only about making the world more convenient, but also about making the world better in a sustainable manner. <br/>\n",
    "Let us give some concrete examples of how materials development through atomistic simulations can be used to approach the realization of a sustainable world.\n",

    "### Ammonia synthesis catalyst\n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning of the 20th century, the explosive growth of the world's population led to a food crisis, increasing grain productivity was an urgent matter. <br/>\n",
    "There are three essentials needed for grain production: water, sunlight, and good quality soil.\n",
    "Since nutrients in the soil are absorbed by plants, a good fertilizer is needed for a consistent annual harvest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fertilizers require a nitrogen component, but artificial fertilizers such as manure were used at that time, making mass production difficult. <br/>\n",
    "Under these social conditions, the Haber-Bosch process, which synthesizes ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) from nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) in the air by using iron as a catalyst, was established, making it possible to produce synthetic fertilizers.\n",
    "In other words, the Haber-Bosch process made it possible to \"make bread from air\" and industrial production of food became possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is developed in 1906 and is still used in various industrial processes more than a century later, with the base catalytic material remaining the same.\n",
    "However it is a method that consumes large amounts of energy.\n",
    "It has been reported that 2% of the world's energy consumption is used for the Haber-Bosch process.\n",
    "If a catalyst can be found that improves the efficiency of the reaction, the effect will be significant.\n",

    "### Battery materials\n",
    "\n",
    "The demand for energy storage is increasing rapidly for smartphones, computers, electric vehicles, and household storage batteries etc. <br/>\n",
    "When charging and discharging a lithium-ion battery, lithium (Li) moves in and out of the electrolyte. So, the speed at which Li moves within the battery is important.\n",
    "The all-solid-state lithium-ion battery is one of the most promising developments in the storage battery market because of its high level of safety, however, it is difficult to conduct Li ions at high speed, which is a barrier to full-scale mass production. It is important to develop a solid electrolyte with high ion conductivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following calculation example, the diffusion coefficient of Li ions is obtained by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation at the atomic level. It shows atomistic simulation can be useful for the development of solid electrolyte materials.\n",

    "### Hydrogen and synthetic fuel generation catalysts for renewable energy storage\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of renewable energy is increasing as part of efforts to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> in the world.\n",
    "Solar and wind power generation is limited to favorable conditions (e.g., clear skies, daytime, weather front).\n",
    "Storage of this energy will be necessary for further expansion of its use in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is estimated that battery storage alone is not large enough in scale to store the energy required from these intermittent sources.\n",
    "Energy storage by converting to hydrogen or methane, which can be stored on a large scale using existing facilities, is considered promising.\n",
    "Currently, the challenge is to find a catalyst that can achieve highly efficient conversion of these reactions:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Making hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) and oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) from water (H<sub>2</sub>O)\n",
    " - Produce synthetic fuels such as methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) from hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)\n",
    "\n",
    "If a catalyst that can increase the efficiency of such reactions can be found, \n",
    "it is expected to be possible to store energy obtained from renewable energy and use it at another time and place.\n",
