    "# ASE Calculator\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous section, we learned the basics about ASE Atoms and how to generate structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will learn how to handle `Calculator`, which is necessary for physical simulations.\n",

    "## Energy\n",
    "\n",
    "The total energy $E$ of the system is expressed in terms of the kinetic energy $K$ and the potential energy $V$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ E = K + V $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Of these, the kinetic energy $K$ of atoms can be calculated as follows, from classical mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ K = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{1}{2} m_i {\\mathbf{v}}_i^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{{\\mathbf{p}}_i^2}{2 m_i}  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $m_i, \\mathbf{v}_i, \\mathbf{p}_i$ are the mass, velocity and momentum ($\\mathbf{p}=m\\mathbf{v}$) of each atom, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Those in bold represent vectors, where the velocity $\\mathbf{v}$ and momentum $\\mathbf{p}$ have three components in xyz coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the potential energy $V$ is not easy to obtain exactly because it requires solving equations derived from quantum mechanics (e.g., Schrödinger equation, see column). <br/>\n",
    "There are various methods for determining potential energy, ranging from classical force fields, which is fast but limited in its applicability, to quantum chemical calculations such as the density functional theory (DFT), which takes longer but is more accurate (The differences between these methods are discussed below).\n",
    "\n",
    "So why do we want to know about energy in the first place? \n",
    "In another word, what can we learn from energy? \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we can know the **stable structure** of a substance, which is not self-evident in nature (as explained in chapter 2).\n",
    "By looking at the low and high energies, we can analyze whether the structure is realized in nature or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we can learn **how each atom moves**. This will be explained in the next section."

    "## Force\n",
    "\n",
    "In classical mechanics, Newton's equations of motion are expressed as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{F} = m\\mathbf{a}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation represents that given a force $\\mathbf{F}$, we know the acceleration $\\mathbf{a}$ applied to the system. <br/>\n",

    "$$\\mathbf{a} = \\frac{d\\mathbf{v}}{dt} = \\frac{d^2\\mathbf{r}}{dt^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, when we know the force, we know the acceleration (= how the velocity changes), and as a result, we know how the position evolves over time. <br/>\n",
    "MD (Molecular Dynamics), which actually deals with time evolution in this way, is covered in chapter 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "The forces can be expressed as the derivative of the potential energy with resprect to positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{F} = -\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial \\mathbf{r}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, <b>the force $\\mathbf{F}$, required to know the time evolution $\\mathbf{r}(t)$ of the system, can be calculated if the potential energy $V\\mathbf(r)$ is known</b>.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Note] For the sake of simplicity, this tutorial has been explained using only knowledge of [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics). <br/>\n",
    "For those who have studied [analytical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_mechanics#Hamiltonian_mechanics), the governing equations are defined by the Hamiltonian.\n",
