    "Since the vibration analysis in this section and phonon analysis in the next section are based on the harmonic approximation, it is important to understand the structures and cases for which this approximation is valid.\n",
    "The harmonic approximation is based on the potential energy with spring $1/2 k x^2$, to represent the potential energy near the stable structure. As shown in the figure below, the larger displacement of each atom from the origin, the larger force it will receive to pull it back to the origin.\n",
    "In other words, it is valid for structures such as solids, where the atoms stay in their positions, but **not for fluids or gases, where each atom is not in a fixed place to begin with**.\n",

    "This is also related to temperature. When a substance is above its melting point and in a liquid state, the harmonic approximation is not valid. <br/>\n",
    "As a rule of thumb, the accuracy of the harmonic oscillator approximation drops significantly as one approaches the melting point and it is only valid **in the low temperature range**."
